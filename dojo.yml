      - id: quessnumber
        name: quessnumber
        description: I made for my 13 year old son, when he wanted to test his hacking skills. There are at least three different ways to play with this simply challenge - scripting (brute force), - reverse engineering by Ida/similar and - GDB (Linux debugger). Maybe this was not the best introduction challenge for my son, because he lost his interest in hacking after playing with this one ðŸ™‚

      - id: idan23
        name: idan23
        description: an Idan23-interpreted language one. Intended solution for this functioned nicely for most of Yan85 challenges as an unintended solution (pwn.college years 21-22 edition). You will lose many fun if use it for them all.

      - id: quessnumber2
        name: quessnumber2
        description: a bit more complicated variant of the first one. Still need to enter a correct number but now its not a fixed one, and processing of an user given number seems to take almost as long as delivery of pwn.college belts ðŸ™‚

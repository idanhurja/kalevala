          I made this challenge for my 13 year old son, when he wanted to test his hacking skills. There are at least three different ways to play with this simply challenge 
          > - scripting (brute force), 
          > - reverse engineering by Ida/similar and 
          > - GDB (Linux debugger)
          Maybe this was not the best introduction challenge for my son, because he lost his interest in hacking after playing with this one ðŸ™‚

        description: In this challenge you have an opportunity to play with Idan23-interpreted language. Intended solution for this functioned nicely for most of Yan85 challenges as an unintended solution (pwn.college years 21-22 edition). You will lose many fun if use it for them all. To guarantee superior hacker experience, corrupted Idan23-program files are not executed.

      - id: quessnumber2
        name: quessnumber2
        description: a bit more complicated variant of the first one. Still need to enter a correct number but now its not a fixed one, and processing of an user given number seems to take almost as long as delivery of pwn.college belts ðŸ™‚

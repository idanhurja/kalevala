          I made this challenge for my 13 year old son, when he wanted to test his hacking skills. Maybe this was not the best introduction challenge for my son, because he lost his interest in hacking after playing with this one ðŸ™‚ There are at least three different ways to play with this simply challenge 
          - scripting (brute force), 
          - reverse engineering by Ida/similar and 
          - GDB (Linux debugger)

      - id: idan23
        name: idan23
        description: In this challenge you have an opportunity to play with Idan23-interpreted language. Intended solution for this functioned nicely for most of Yan85 challenges as an unintended solution (pwn.college years 21-22 edition). You will lose many fun if use it for them all. To guarantee superior hacker experience, corrupted Idan23-program files are not executed.

      - id: guessnumber2
        name: guessnumber2
        description: a bit more complicated variant of the first one. Still need to enter a correct number but now its not a fixed one, and processing of an user given number seems to take almost as long as delivery of pwn.college belts ðŸ™‚
